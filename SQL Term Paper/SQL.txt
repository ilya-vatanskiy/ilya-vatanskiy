Hello,

Via this link (https://metabase.sky.pro/question/88231) you can find my SQL term paper and below just a couple words what I have done and what resulut I achived there.

My task is to simulate the change in student balances. The balance is the number of lessons each student has.

To check if everything is OK with our data, to make a list of hypotheses and questions, it is important for us to understand:

- how many lessons were on the balance ** of all students ** for each calendar day;
- how this amount changed under the influence of transactions (payments, accruals, corrective write-offs) and lessons (write-offs from the balance as lessons go through).

I also wanted to create a table where there will be balances ** of each student** for each day.

The result is a query that collects data on students' balances for each day they have lived.
